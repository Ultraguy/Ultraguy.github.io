        Set the colors, and drag your mouse to place random pixels.<br>
        After you place a few pixels, click generate image to start having those pixels grow. (You can still place pixels, and change the color while it's generating)<br>
        The change of the color overtime is controlled by the colorChange variable.<br>
        Weird Mode makes everything more strand-y and sharp.<br>
        To clear the canvas, reload the page<br>
        Beware as it will lag a bit during the generating of the image, since it needs to do pixel-by-pixel operations<br>
